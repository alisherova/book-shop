FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information. Such s- tems arebecoming increasinglyimportantalsodue to the huge andalwaysgr- ing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.",

                "description": "There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration. Table of Contents: Introduction / Query Interface Representation and Extraction / Query Interface Clustering and Categorization / Query Interface Matching / Query Interface Attribute Integration / Query Interface Integration / Summary and Future Research",

He's timed the arrival of his computer components with the holiday vacation from school to blast aliens and enemy soldiers alike on his brand new, high-end gaming computer. When the parts arrive, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't what he ordered from TechTerritory. Thinking he's the butt of a practical joke, Tyler plays along, and builds the computer with the obviously fake components. His annoyance turns to shock when the computer powers on. His shock turns to a mix of disbelief and wonder when he learns the strange \"quantum\" computer can pull web pages from the near future. Disbelief and wonder soon become fear and uncertainty when he discovers the future might not be so bright. \"Search Terms: Alpha\" is the first half of a new time travel thriller. 52,000 word novel Adult themes / language / mild sexual content",
